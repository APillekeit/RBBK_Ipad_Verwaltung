The AI engineer successfully developed a comprehensive iPad management web application from scratch, addressing 15 initial and numerous subsequent user requirements. The development followed an iterative approach, starting with core features like Excel file uploads for iPads and students, automatic assignment, and basic CRUD operations. Key challenges involved correctly parsing Excel/PDF data, handling Pydantic validation for optional fields, and resolving JavaScript event handler issues, particularly with the  dialog for dissolution actions. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, consistently addressing user feedback by identifying root causes (e.g., URL encoding for filters, browser security issues with , re-creating test data) and implementing robust solutions like the double-click confirmation system. The latest work focused on UI/UX refinements, increased upload limits, and a critical contract validation warning system within the assignments view, confirming all requested features.

<product_requirements>
The user required a web-based iPad management tool to administer iPad-student assignments and contracts.
Key workflows and features include:
1.  **iPad Management**: Upload Excel (ipads.xlsx) to add new iPads (identified by ITNr), view existing iPads, mark iPads as defekt or gestohlen, and filter by status.
2.  **Student Management**: Upload Excel (schildexport.xlsx) to add new students, with a unique primary key per student.
3.  **Assignment Management**:
    *   Automatic assignment of students to available iPads.
    *   View filtered assignments (by first name, last name, class).
    *   Export all assignments as XLSX.
    *   Dissolve individual assignments or batch-dissolve filtered assignments. If a contract exists, move it to history; otherwise, mark the iPad as free. Dissolving also occurs automatically if an iPad is marked defekt or gestohlen, or set to verfügbar.
    *   Show a warning icon for assignments with contracts where specific validation (NutzungEinhaltung, NutzungKenntnisnahme, (ausgabeNeu XOR ausgabeGebraucht) is not met; double-click to dismiss.
4.  **Contract Management**:
    *   Upload PDF contracts (Muster.pdf) containing field names (ITNr, SuSVorn, SuSNachn) matching assignment data.
    *   Validate PDF fields against assignment data upon upload (ITNr, SuSVorn, SuSNachn match, specific checkboxes are selected).
    *   Allow multiple contract uploads (up to 50 files) where contracts with fields are auto-assigned (without strict validation), and contracts without fields are marked unzugewiesen for manual assignment via dropdowns.
    *   View current and historical contracts for an iPad (including download capability for historical contracts).
    *   View/delete unassigned contracts.
5.  **Data Management**:
    *   Manually delete individual students/iPads (with history), issuing warnings for active assignments.
    *   Implement a data protection feature to delete student and contract data older than 5 years (double-click activated).
    *   Add timestamps to database entries for data retention.
6.  **UI/UX**: Admin login, clear UI for all management tasks, and improved layout for upload hints.

<current_work>
The immediately preceding work involved implementing three specific user requests related to the contract and assignment management:
1.  **Relocating Contract Upload Hints**: The informational guidelines for contract uploads were moved from the bottom of the Contracts tab to directly beneath the file upload area, improving user experience by placing relevant information closer to the action.
2.  **Increasing Contract Upload Limit**: The backend's simultaneous contract upload limit was increased from 20 to 50 files. This was updated in the backend logic, allowing users to process a larger batch of contracts at once.
3.  **Implementing Contract Validation Warnings**: A new system was added to the Assignments tab to visually alert users to contracts that failed specific validation criteria related to checkbox selections (NutzungEinhaltung, NutzungKenntnisnahme, (ausgabeNeu XOR ausgabeGebraucht)). If a contract fails this check, the corresponding assignment row is marked with an orange border, an  icon appears next to the iPad ITNr, and a ⚠️ Validation label is displayed. This warning can be dismissed by a double-click on the icon.

These features were implemented across the backend () for logic and limits, and the frontend (, ) for UI changes and visual feedback. The engineer confirmed successful implementation and functionality through screenshots and console logs.
