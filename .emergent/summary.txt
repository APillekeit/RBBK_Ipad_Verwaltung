<analysis>
The previous AI engineer focused on implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and robust installation/maintenance scripts. This involved extensive backend modifications to  for user models, authentication, and resource ownership validation (user_id filtering). Frontend  was updated for role-based UI. Significant effort went into improving  to handle environment setups, Docker conflicts, and automatic admin user creation with correct MongoDB authentication. Troubleshooting recurring  errors and Docker Compose pathing was also a major part of the work. The current block is focused on addressing a persistent  error preventing the backend from starting.

<product_requirements>
The user required a secure, web-based iPad management tool for administering iPad-student assignments and contracts. The application should support:
1.  **iPad Management**: Upload, view, status update, filter.
2.  **Student Management**: Upload, view, cascading delete.
3.  **Assignment Management**: Auto-assignment, filtered view, XLSX export with corrected columns, dissolve, contract validation, new contract upload.
4.  **Contract Management**: PDF upload, auto-assign (including filename-based), manual assignment, view/download.
5.  **Data Management**: Manual student/iPad deletion, data protection, inventory import (iPad, student, assignment creation).
6.  **UI/UX**: Admin login, clear UI, improved upload hints, global settings for default iPad/Pencil, user-friendly design, automatic logout, password/username change.
7.  **Docker Deployment**: Complete Docker setup (MongoDB, Nginx, React, FastAPI) on Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.
**New Requirements**:
8.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: All resources to be user-specific. Admin accounts can see all data and create new users. System with admin and user roles.
9.  **Robust Installation Scripts**:  to check for previous installations, offer cleanup/backup, handle Docker Compose versions, ensure correct  user creation with a default password.
10. **Troubleshooting & Documentation**: Address RAM issues during build, container conflicts,  file creation errors, and provide clear documentation for these.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **FastAPI**: Python backend, Pydantic for data validation.
-   **React**: JavaScript frontend, Shadcn UI, Radix UI.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database, UUIDs (instead of ObjectIDs), authenticated access.
-   **Docker / Docker Compose**: Containerization and orchestration.
-   **Pandas, Openpyxl, PyPDF2**: Python for Excel/PDF processing.
-   ** (libmagic)**: File type validation.
-   ****: Asynchronous MongoDB driver.
-   ****: Password hashing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a microservices architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database, all containerized with Docker and orchestrated using Docker Compose. Nginx acts as a reverse proxy.

    *   **Changes Made**: Updated login component to store .  component manages  state.  conditionally displays User Management tab for admins. New  component allows admin to manage users.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: Configures the multi-container Docker application.
    *   **Changes Made**: Corrected relative build paths (e.g.,  changed to ) to resolve build errors. MongoDB authentication credentials were configured here.

-   **Complete  installation in Dockerfile**: The backend service fails to start due to , which is essential for file validation (a security feature). This needs to be resolved by modifying the .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was systematically debugging a critical backend startup issue on the user's  environment. The backend consistently failed to launch with an  within the Docker container. This prevents the FastAPI server from running and, consequently, all API endpoints (including login) from responding, leading to Connection reset by peer or 502 Bad Gateway errors. This issue persists despite previous attempts to install  (Chat Message 152-153, 403-404) and re-verified backend services. The  user's password () has been confirmed to be correctly set in the MongoDB database, with appropriate authentication credentials now being used in helper scripts like . However, without a running backend, frontend login attempts (e.g., from ) will continue to fail. The very last message confirms the  import error as the root cause.
